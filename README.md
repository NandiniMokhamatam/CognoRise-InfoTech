In this repository, you'll find three projects that showcase my proficiency in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The first project is an online quiz app designed to engage users with interactive quizzes. The second project is a calculator application that provides basic arithmetic functionality within a sleek web interface. Lastly, I've developed a to-do list application to help users organize their tasks efficiently. These projects not only demonstrate my technical skills but also reflect my dedication to creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. Check out the repository for more details and feel free to explore the codebase to see how each project was implemented.
